            While researching how to better optimize, measure, and control page load and interaction time, along with the size of JS code.
            Previously they had systems to alerted them when problems arose both before and after code was in production.
            They had never done much in terms of managing memory while in browser, but discovered Facebook's memory usage and memory crashes on the client side were rising.

            <h3 style="height: 25px">Obviously, high memory usage would negatively affect parts of the user experience and website statistics such as</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Load time</li>
                <li>Interaction length</li>
                <li>Number of active users</li>
                <li>Time spent on websites</li>
                <li>number of activities performed</li>
